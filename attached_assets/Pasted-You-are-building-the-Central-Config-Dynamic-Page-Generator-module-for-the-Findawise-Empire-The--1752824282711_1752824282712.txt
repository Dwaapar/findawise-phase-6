You are building the “Central Config + Dynamic Page Generator” module for the Findawise Empire.
The goal: Create a framework-independent, modular codebase that generates every page dynamically from a central config file (JSON or TS), with full support for niche, emotion-based theming, and pluggable interactive modules (quiz, calculator, comparison, etc.).

Follow these steps:

Create config/pages.json

For each page, include:

slug

title

description

niche

emotion (e.g. "trust", "excitement", "relief")

interactiveModule (e.g. "quiz", "calculator", "comparison")

contentPointer (relative file path for content)

cta (text, link)

Provide 3-5 real example pages across different niches and emotions.

Write the Dynamic Page Generator:

Use /pages/[slug].tsx (for React/Next) or /src/pages/[slug].js (for JS/TS).

It must:

Read the config file

On each route, render the correct page (title, meta, emotion/theme, content)

Load the correct interactive module dynamically by config (use simple placeholders if actual modules aren't coded yet)

Display the CTA button and inject the content from the pointer

All theming logic for emotion (background, accent colors) should be handled via a simple EmotionMap object in code.

Code must be clean, commented, and exportable.

Documentation:

Output a clear README.md (Hindi/English mix is fine) explaining:

What is built

How to add new pages/niches

How to plug in additional modules (e.g., quiz engine, calculator)

How to export/import this module to the next Replit instance

Don’t compress, minimize, or skip logic to save tokens. Output the best code you can, up to token limit.

If you hit a token or output limit, just explain what’s done and what’s left for the next Replit.

Important notes:

This module is the brainstem. Every future module (Quiz, Calculator, Affiliate, Blog, EmotionMap, etc.) will plug into this core generator.

Har page config-driven hona chahiye, koi static nahi.

Modular likh, export/import simple ho.

Documentation clean ho, koi confusion nahi.

This should feel like the foundation of a billion-dollar, self-evolving AI web empire.
