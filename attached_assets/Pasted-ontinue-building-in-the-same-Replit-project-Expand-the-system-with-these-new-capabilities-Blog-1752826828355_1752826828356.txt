ontinue building in the same Replit project.
Expand the system with these new capabilities:

Blog Content Auto-Generator (AI + Markdown Support):

Add logic to load and render external Markdown files (via contentPointer) for every page.

Use a library like react-markdown (or any framework-compatible option) to render content as styled HTML, not just plain text.

(Optional but preferred:) Add a simple script, button, or CLI tool that uses OpenAI (or mock API) to auto-generate blog post Markdown for new pages based on page config (title, niche, emotion, etc.), saving files to /content.

Showcase Blog Content In-Page:

For each page generated by the DynamicPageGenerator, display blog content (from Markdown) within a styled section/component—must look clean, SEO-friendly, and emotion-themed.

Use the page’s emotion theme from EmotionMap for headings, highlights, etc.

Export/Import Booster:

Add a new section to README.md called “Export/Import Guide for Next Replit/Module.”

List precisely which files/folders must be zipped and exported to migrate this module elsewhere.

Example: /src/config/pages.json, /src/content/, /src/components/DynamicPageGenerator.tsx, /src/components/InteractiveModules/, /src/config/emotionMap.ts, etc.

Document how to “plug and play” this whole setup in a new Replit or stack it as a new module.

If time and space allow, add:

A BlogManager UI for admins: lets you see, add, or edit blog content files per page in the browser (nice-to-have, not must-have).

No token-minimization, no “summary” outputs—give full, detailed, production-grade code, comments, and updated README.

English for README instructions:

log content should be loaded from a Markdown file for each page (using contentPointer).

Write the export/import process clearly step-by-step, so there is no confusion.

Provide demo config + a sample blog Markdown file for reference.

If OpenAI or any API is being used, show how to auto-generate Markdown via a simple CLI or button.

Based on emotion, the UI should apply a matching theme, so that the blog looks visually appealing.
