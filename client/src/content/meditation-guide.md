# Meditation Guide & Timer

## The Science of Meditation

Meditation is more than just sitting quietly - it's a practice that literally rewires your brain. Neuroscientists have found that regular meditation:

- **Increases gray matter** in areas associated with learning and memory
- **Reduces activity** in the default mode network (associated with mind-wandering)
- **Strengthens connections** between the prefrontal cortex and emotional centers
- **Decreases cortisol** levels, reducing stress and inflammation
